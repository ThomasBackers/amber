## A social network project

### What would my ideal social network look like?

Probably an application that would treat the terms 'network' and 'social' on the same level.

Since this is about learning how to use the MEVN stack, the code is open source, but I think it also goes particularly well with the term 'social'.

For the network side, the ideal would be to allow people to express themselves in a creative way, and why not in a way that is only possible with the digital format. It would also be interesting to work on the way users can meet each other.

And while we're at it, we might as well try to get a glimpse of what a social network that cares about its users first might look like.

### A vast program

but it fits very well with the idea of learning and experimenting a lot
